# ![Angular Example App](logo.png)


This codebase was created to demonstrate a fully fledged application built with Angular that interacts with an actual backend server including CRUD operations, authentication, routing, pagination, and more. We've gone to great lengths to adhere to the [Angular Styleguide](https://angular.io/styleguide) & best practices.


# How it works

I'm currently working on some docs for the codebase (explaining where functionality is located, how it works, etc) but the codebase should be straightforward to follow as is.

### Building the project
Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Functionality overview
**General functionality:**

- Authenticate users via JWT (login/signup pages + logout button on settings page)
- CRU* users (sign up & settings page - no deleting required)
- CRUD Articles
- CR*D Comments on articles (no updating required)
- GET and display paginated lists of articles
- Favorite articles
- Follow other users

**The general page breakdown looks like this:**

- Home page (URL: /#/ )
    - List of tags
    - List of articles pulled from either Feed, Global, or by Tag
    - Pagination for list of articles
- Sign in/Sign up pages (URL: /#/login, /#/register )
    - Uses JWT (store the token in localStorage)
    - Authentication can be easily switched to session/cookie based
- Settings page (URL: /#/settings )
- Editor page to create/edit articles (URL: /#/editor, /#/editor/article-slug-here )
- Article page (URL: /#/article/article-slug-here )
    - Delete article button (only shown to article's author)
    - Render markdown from server client side
    - Comments section at bottom of page
    - Delete comment button (only shown to comment's author)
- Profile page (URL: /#/profile/:username, /#/profile/:username/favorites )
    - Show basic user info
    - List of articles populated from author's created articles or author's favorited articles
